# BMM150 SPI/IRQ demo

This folder contains a demonstration programme showing the functionality
of the magnetometer sensor connected via SPI and using interrupt to signal
when measurement is complete. The demo uses the STM32 F4VE board.
The program reads sensor data and prints it over ST-Util semihosting
interface.

## Requirements

* STM32 F4VE development board
* Any BMM150 module
* ST-Link V2 debug probe
* Development environment compatible with STM32F4 microcontrollers

## Setup

* Attach BMM150 by SPI to
  * SCK  - PB13
  * MISO - PB14
  * MOSI - PB15
  * CS   - PB10
  * DRDY - PB6
* Attach the debug probe to the designated port on the STM32F4VE board.
* Connect the STM32 F4VE board to your development environment.

## Usage

Compile and upload the program to the STM32 F4VE board. Upon successful upload,
the demonstration program will run, printing sensor data over semishosting
channel. To see the output

* launch a debug session in GNAT Studio, or
* run the debugger in the command line:

  ```sh
  st-util --semihosting
  arm-eabi-gdb -ex 'target remote localhost:4242' -ex cont
  ```
